This script will try and parse information about a git repository (if you are currently standing in one). It will display branch name, upstream name, porcelaine (dirty or not), how many untracked files there are (if any) and more.

## Example output
This is a sketch of how the ouput could end up looking:

> [master] [origin/master] [dirty] [4 untracked files]

> ~/../bash-git-prompt/ $
